# Enables 2013 HWRF-WPAC vertical structure and disable GSI.  GSI
# cannot run with this vertical structure because the model top is too
# low.  Also enables a smaller timestep, and changes movemin to match.
# Note that this is exactly the same as hwrf_other_basins.conf, except
# that this file retains ocean coupling.
