HWRF
====

This is Hurricane WRF (HWRF).

Homepage:       http://www.dtcenter.org/HurrWRF/users/
SVN Repository: https://svn-dtc-hwrf.cgd.ucar.edu/


Prerequisites
-------------

The bulk of the code is written in Fortran, with a sputtering of C and
various Perl and Ksh scripts.

You will need:

1. C and Fortran compilers with MPI (and optionally OpenMP) support.
   Supported compiler suites are:
   - Intel (icc and ifort)    http://www.intel.com/
   - IBM XL (xlc and xlf)     http://www.ibm.com/
   - PGI (pgc and pgcfortran) http://www.pgroup.com/
   - GNU (gcc and gfortran)   http://gcc.gnu.org/

2. GNU Make.                   http://www.gnu.org/software/make/

3. Perl.                       http://www.perl.org/

4. Korn shell (ksh88).         http://web.cs.mun.ca/~michael/pdksh/


Building
--------

To build and install all HWRF components with the default site compilers:
	% cd sorc
	% make
	% make install

If this was sucessful all the binaries will be located in the "exec"
directory.

A more detailed build explanation and available options are within the
"sorc" directory README and Makefile, please read these.


Usage
-----

It should be noted that a few programs (real and wrf) require large stacks.
Therefore it is advised that your login shell set a stack size of
approximately 500M.
In bash:
	% ulimit -s 524288
In csh:
	% limit stacksize 524288


Layout
------

The current toplevel directory layout is as follows:

 --\
    +-- exec            HWRF compiled executables.
    |
    +-- jobs            SMS job scripts to set environment variables.
    |
    +-- kick_scripts    Toplevel scripts to run the sms/job scripts.
    |
    +-- nwjet           Jet[1] specific programs and libraries.
    |
    +-- parm            Parameter files.
    |
    +-- scripts         Mid-level scripts.
    |
    +-- sorc            Source directory containing all HWRF components.
    |
    \-- ush             Low-level scripts to run HWRF executables.


The existence of multiple script directories is consequence of the
National Weather Service (NWS), National Centers for Environmental
Prediction (NCEP) Central Operations (NCO) ( http://www.nco.ncep.noaa.gov/ ).
It is a three tiered structure, the toplevel is "jobs", midlevel "scripts"
and the lowest level is "ush".

 Precedence: jobs --> scripts --> ush

Where by the "jobs" scripts contain the Supervisory Monitoring System (SMS)
commands and environment variables needed to run a HWRF simulation. This is
the entry point for NCO.

The "scripts" scripts the mid-level scripts containing all the logic for
running a HWRF simulation.

The "ush" scripts are the low-level scripts that run HWRF binaries.

1. Jet ( https://jetdocs.rdhpcs.noaa.gov/wiki/index.php/Main_Page ) is
   NOAA's current Research and Development High Performance Computing
   System (HPCS) located at Earth Systems Research Laboratory's (ESRL)
   Global Systems Division (GSD) in Boulder, Colorado. It is currently
   an Intel (x86) cluster.
