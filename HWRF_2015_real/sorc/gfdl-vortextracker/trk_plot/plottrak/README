Setting up and running ATCF Plot

1. The two executables, ndate.x in the directory ndate.cd/, and nhour
in the directory nhour.fd/, are no longer needed.  They have been replaced
by the Korn shell scripts, ndate.ksh and nhour.ksh located in the same
directory as all other ATCF Plot scripts.   These scripts require use
of the GNU version of the "date" Unix command.  If the default date command
on your system is not GNU date, you may need to edit the following line in
both ndate.ksh and nhour.ksh to point to the GNU version of date

    3 GNUDATE=date

If GNU date is not available on your system, you will need to build the ndate.x
and nhour executables by following these instructions:
	cd ndate.cd
	make
	cd ../nhour.fd
	make
Once built, the two executables are placed into the exec/ directory. Make certain
there are there before proceeding.  You must then edit the following paths in 
get_mods.sh, get_verif.sh, and step_dates.sh to use the ndate.x and nhour executables.
  ndate=/wrfclass/users/${USER}/HWRF/src/gfdl-vortextracker/trk_plot/plottrak/ndate.ksh
  nhour=/wrfclass/users/${USER}/HWRF/src/gfdl-vortextracker/trk_plot/plottrak/nhour.ksh

2. You will need to rerun gribmap on the GrADS ctl file.  gribmap is a
GrADS utility that maps what is in your ctl file ("plottrak.ctl") with
the binary data that it finds inside your actual GRIB data file.  It
creates a map (plottrak.ix) that points to the locations where the
requested binary data starts for the different variables and levels.
Create the map file by using the command:
	gribmap -v -i plottrak.ctl
You should see one line in the output that has "MATCH" in the string.
Both the plottrack.ctl and the newly created plottrak.ix map file need
to be in the same directory where you are running the script below.

3. Edit the following paths in atcfplot.sh
     84 export gradsv2=/.automounts/local_mmm/grads-1.9b4/bin/gradsc
     85 export GADDIR=/.automounts/local_mmm/grads-1.9b4/data
     86
     87 export scrdir=/wrfclass/users/${USER}/HWRF/src/gfdl-vortextracker/trk_plot/plottrak/
     88 export plotdir=/wrfclass/users/${USER}/HWRF/src/gfdl-vortextracker/trk_plot/plottrak/tracks
Set the paths to the correct locations for your system.

4. Edit the following paths in atcfplot.gs, replace ${USER} with users name
     23 _rundir="/wrfclass/users/${USER}/HWRF/src/gfdl-vortextracker/trk_plot/plottrak/"
     24 _netdir="/wrfclass/users/${USER}/HWRF/src/gfdl-vortextracker/trk_plot/plottrak/tracks/"
Set the paths to the correct locations for your system.

5. Edit the following paths in get_mods.sh
     40 rundir=/wrfclass/users/${USER}/HWRF/src/gfdl-vortextracker/trk_plot/plottrak/
     41 netdir=/wrfclass/users/${USER}/HWRF/src/gfdl-vortextracker/trk_plot/plottrak/tracks
     42 ndate=/wrfclass/users/${USER}/HWRF/src/gfdl-vortextracker/trk_plot/plottrak/exec/ndate.x
     43 nhour=/wrfclass/users/${USER}/HWRF/src/gfdl-vortextracker/trk_plot/plottrak/exec/nhour
Set the paths to the correct locations for your system.

6. Edit the following paths in get_verif.sh
     37 rundir=/wrfclass/users/${USER}/HWRF/src/gfdl-vortextracker/trk_plot/plottrak/
     38 netdir=/wrfclass/users/${USER}/HWRF/src/gfdl-vortextracker/trk_plot/plottrak/tracks
     39 ndate=/wrfclass/users/${USER}/HWRF/src/gfdl-vortextracker/trk_plot/plottrak/exec/ndate.x
     40 nhour=/wrfclass/users/${USER}/HWRF/src/gfdl-vortextracker/trk_plot/plottrak/exec/nhour
Set the paths to the correct locations for your system.

7. Run the script
	atcfplot.sh 2009 al
This selects stroms from the year 2009 in the atlantic basin.

From the drop down menu, select a strom, and then select a start date.
