HWRF version 0.01
=================

This HWRF package is a group of Perl modules to manipulate and
interact with the HWRF suite.

The current modules supported are:
  - HWRF Utilities
  - HWRF TnE
  - WRF
  - WPS
  - WPP
  - GSI
  - POMTC
  - NCEP Coupler
  - GFDL Vortex Tracker
  - Workflow Manager

Included in this distribution are a few scripts to be used as
interfaces for the actual HWRF modules. In the "bin" directory, you
will find:

  - build_HWRF : build the complete HWRF suite
  - run_HWRF   : run a built HWRF suite

If you are more interested in using the HWRF modules directly, then
you examine this scripts and some of the testing scripts in the "t"
directory.

There are manual pages for the scripts and modules.

INSTALLATION
------------

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

If you are unable to write to the systems default installation directory
(as in you do not have root access). You can specify an installation
base with:
   perl Makefile.PL INSTALL_BASE=${HOME}

In this case the perl module will be install:
   executables => ${HOME}/bin
   libaries    => ${HOME}/lib/perl5
   man pages   => ${HOME}/man

If your ExtUtils::MakeMaker does not understand the INSTALL_BASE argument
you can fall back to the old PREFIX method. However some systems will
the place the libraries in site specific directories like
lib/aix-thread-multi/ . If this is the case you will need to edit the
scripts in bin/ so they can find the HWRF module. That is the "use lib"
line. There are two alternatives to this.

1. Explicitly set the library path during configuration:
       perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=${HOME} LIB=${HOME}/lib/perl5
   Since the scripts have the following lines:
       use FindBin qw($Bin);
       use lib "$Bin/../lib/perl5";

2. At run time set your PERL5LIB environment variable to the directory
   containing the HWRF module (that is the HWRF.pm file).
