The original POM serial code is reconfigured into :

   pom.f : main dirver
   initialize.f : set up the problem
   advance.f : advance the code in time
   bounds_forcing.f : conditions, atmospheric forcing, restoring...
   solver.f : subroutines for basic dynamics
   parallel_mpi.f : parallel tasks (communications between processors)
   io_pnetcdf.F : parallel I/O

The following files should always be identical here and in ../../ocean_main/pom :

   initialize.f
   advance.f
   bounds_forcing.f
   solver.f
   io_pnetcdf.F
   hurricane_wind.f
   smoothing.f
   geovel.f
   calcpwave.f
   pom.h
   pom.nml

If a change is made to any of these files here, an identical change should be made
   to the analogous file in ../../ocean_main/pom

Note that pom.f is here only, drive_ocean.f is there only, and parallel_mpi.f
   is slightly different here vs. there.
