*********Instructions for running the HWRF parallel graphics scripts suite**********

1) Make sure the entire /PARA directory has been copied from /global/save/hurpara/wx20jo/PARA to 
   a location of your choosing.

2)In the following scripts, edit the "sorc", "data_dir", "work", and "archive_base" variables
  to make sure they match the location where your data will be located and where your PARA
  directory is located:
        movie_combine.sh
        nest_center.sh
        vert_sect.sh
        plot_swath.sh
        plot_goes.sh
        intensityplot.sh
        trackplot.sh

   The scripts are set up to automatically determine the "${user}" using the `whoami` command. 

3)Check for any occurrences of "wx20jo" in the following scripts and edit them for your username or
  directory location:
        scp_to_rzdm.sh
        hwrf_graphics.sh
        trackplot.sh
        intensityplot.sh

4)Once the scripts have been edited for your directory structure, and there are no more occurrences of
  "wx20jo" in the scripts in the PARA directory, make sure that a "CRONTAB_OUT" directory exists in your 
  /stmp/$user directory. If one doesn't exist, create it. This is where the script .out and .err files
  go when the main graphics script is run. These files can be used to diagnose a script problem. If a
  CRONTAB_OUT directory does not exist, the graphics scripts will fail.

5)Run the "hwrf_graphics.sh" script, which will run all the other graphics scripts, using the following
  command:

   sh hwrf_graphics.sh  STORM   stormid   YYYYMMDDHH   EXP_NAME

  Example:
  STORM = ADRIAN
  stormid = 01e
  YYYYMMDDHH = 2011061212
  EXP_NAME = TDRP

6)The hwrf_graphics.sh script runs the scp_to_rzdm.sh script, which automatically pushes the graphics
  output to the parallel website. If this doesn't work due to access issues with RZDM (no account or
  passwordless access isn't set up for you), notify Janna O'Connor at janna.oconnor@noaa.gov and 
  provide her with the output location for the graphics you have created. She will push this data
  to the appropriate website.

7)Any other questions or issues can be sent to Janna O'Connor at janna.oconnor@noaa.gov
